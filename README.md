# Login-Registration-System



Its one of the simplest project I was assigned by the college to show how system file works on the computer using C++.

Firstly, in this project we were thoroughly taught about File handling in C as well as C++, then we were assighned different projects based on file management system. 


This project involves user registration system and login system.

If someone is new to the system, it asks the user for a usename and password.
Upon registration, a user file is created and if not 
upon login, it will throw an error.
